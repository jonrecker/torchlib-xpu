"""Deterministic checks for dma-buf fd handling and multi-threaded decoding.

The plugin imports the dma-buf exported by VAAPI for every decoded frame. These
tests check the observable effects of doing that correctly: no leaked file
descriptors, no descriptors closed behind other threads' backs, and the same
frames when decoding concurrently as when decoding alone.

"""Multi-threaded dataloader-style workloads, one per concurrency fix.

Each test runs the workload of torchcodec's benchmarks/decoders/
generate_readme_data.py "concurrency" case in a subprocess: a thread pool of
workers, each task creating its own decoder, decoding a batch of frames played
at uniform timestamps, and resizing them on the XPU. Failures here are crashes,
aborts, hangs and GPU resets, which cannot be caught in-process, hence the
subprocess and the timeout.

The failures are timing dependent. Each test is therefore a probabilistic
detector for one fix: it reliably passes with the fix, and it fails with a
probability that depends on the fix, as documented per test. A failure of a
test means the fix it names is missing or broken.
